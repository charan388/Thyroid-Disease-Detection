Thyroid Disease Detection Using Machine Learning:-

This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms for the early detection of thyroid diseases. Thyroid diseases are prevalent worldwide and can have a significant impact on a person's health if not detected and treated promptly. Machine learning provides a promising approach to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing thyroid disorders accurately.

In this repository, you will find the necessary code, datasets, and documentation to replicate the thyroid disease detection model and explore the results.
